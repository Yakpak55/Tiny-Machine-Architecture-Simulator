# Tiny-Machine-Architecture-Simulator
Developed a C program to simulate a variant of the Tiny Machine Architecture, implementing its basic instruction set architecture (ISA). 

The project involved:

● Instruction Set Implementation: Implemented instructions such as LOAD, ADD, STORE, SUB, IN, OUT, END, JMP, and SKIPZ, accurately reflecting the ISA of the Tiny Machine.

● Memory Management: Simulated Instruction Memory (IM) and Data Memory (DM) using separate arrays. Designed structures for CPU registers and utilized them in the fetch and execute cycles.

● Fetch/Execute Cycle: Developed the fetch cycle to load instructions from memory and the execute cycle to perform operations based on opcode. Managed the program counter, instruction register, memory address registers, and accumulator.

● User Interaction: Implemented the IN instruction to interact with users for input. Displayed detailed status messages after each instruction, showing the current state of the program counter, accumulator, and data memory.

● Output Specifications: Provided readable output detailing the simulation's operations, ensuring clarity in program functionality and instruction execution.
